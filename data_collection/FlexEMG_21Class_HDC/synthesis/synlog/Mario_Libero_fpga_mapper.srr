       'Diff grp' indicates that paths exist but the starting clock and ending clock are in different clock groups.

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 14.362 is 5.912(41.2%) logic and 8.450(58.8%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value

Total path delay (propagation time + setup) of 21.473 is 5.129(23.9%) logic and 16.345(76.1%) route.
Path delay compensated for clock skew. Clock skew is added to clock-to-out value, and is subtracted from setup time value
